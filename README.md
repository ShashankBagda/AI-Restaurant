# Smart Restaurant

End-to-End Hospitality Automation Using AI and Software

Smart Restaurant is a next-generation restaurant automation concept that transforms the entire dining experience using Artificial Intelligence, software systems, and smart hardware.

The goal is simple: reduce repetitive human tasks, improve efficiency, and deliver a highly personalized dining experience across locations.

## Why This Exists

Traditional dining flows involve repetitive human effort, delays and miscommunication, limited personalization, and little learning from customer preferences. Smart Restaurant redesigns the journey from entry to exit to make the experience consistent, efficient, and adaptive.

## Experience Flow

   - Instant seating or advance booking.
   - AI assigns tables using party size, availability, past preferences, and occasion.

2. Intelligent Menu and AI Recommendations
   - Menu via mobile, table display, or projection.
   - Recommendations based on taste history, dietary needs, regional popularity, and time of day.

3. Interactive Kitchen Experience
   - Live video call with chefs for customization, ingredients, and allergies.

4. Immersive Dining Ambience
   - Occasion-based themes projected on the table.
   - Lighting and visuals adapt dynamically.

5. Automated Food Delivery
   - Robots deliver food to tables.
   - Staff focus on hospitality.

6. Smart Feedback and Learning
   - Seamless feedback collection.
   - Improves future recommendations for each guest.

- AI: Python services (same stack or separate service).
- Optional later: Java service only for high-throughput enterprise integrations.

## Future Scope

- Multi-language global support.
- Integration with food delivery platforms.
- Nutrition tracking and health recommendations.
- Franchise-ready deployment model.
- AI-driven kitchen optimization.

## Repo Structure

- `Backend` for APIs, AI services, and orchestration.
- `Frontend` for customer and staff apps.

## Vision

Smart Restaurant aims to become the standard operating system for restaurants, redefining hospitality by combining technology, personalization, and efficiency without removing the human touch.
